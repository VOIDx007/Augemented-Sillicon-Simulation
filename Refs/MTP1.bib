	abstract = {Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with ferromagnetic electrodes possessing a perpendicular magnetic easy axis are of great interest as they have a potential  for realizing next-generation high-density non-volatile memory and logic chips  with high thermal stability and low critical current for current-induced  magnetization switching. To attain perpendicular anisotropy, a number of material  systems have been explored as electrodes, which include  rare-earth/transition-metal alloys, L1(0)-ordered (Co, Fe)-Pt alloys and Co/(Pd,  Pt) multilayers. However, none of them so far satisfy high thermal stability at  reduced dimension, low-current current-induced magnetization switching and high  tunnel magnetoresistance ratio all at the same time. Here, we use interfacial  perpendicular anisotropy between the ferromagnetic electrodes and the tunnel  barrier of the MTJ by employing the material combination of CoFeB-MgO, a system  widely adopted to produce a giant tunnel magnetoresistance ratio in MTJs with  in-plane anisotropy. This approach requires no material other than those used in  conventional in-plane-anisotropy MTJs. The perpendicular MTJs consisting of  Ta/CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Ta show a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, over 120\%, high  thermal stability at dimension as low as 40 nm diameter and a low switching  current of 49 microA.},

We find that the ionic relaxations in the metal-oxide  electrode play a crucial role in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase. Comparison  with frozen-phonon calculations shows that the degree of softness of the SrRuO(3)  lattice has an essential impact on the screening of ferroelectric polarization in  BaTiO(3). The critical thickness for ferroelectricity in BaTiO(3) is found to be  1.2 nm. The results of our calculations provide a possible explanation for the  beneficial impact of oxide electrodes on the switching and dielectric properties  of ferroelectric capacitors.},
